Quests and Campaigns
* Should friends be able to anonymously comment on quests if they think the point values are wrong? How do we ensure balance? Do we even need to?
* A campaign is created, a big picture goal (Write a novel, lose 50 lbs, Design a new product, Learn Spanish), then quests can be created that move you towards completing that campaign. 
* Quest completion is, say, 10 points, and campaign completion is, say, 100 points. Testing and adjustment will need to be done with early testers\
* Or, alternatively, maybe players can set their own arbitrary points value to quests and campaigns, based on their perceived level of difficulty. Maybe there’s a range.
* Quests points might scale with time and quality. Complete a time-sensitive quest early and get more points. Do a better job than expected and get more points
* social media posts bragging about quest/campaign completion for individual and guild includes (optional) link to quest summary page, allowing people to see how much the person contributed to the total & other stats


Guilds
* Players can create and join guilds
* Restrictions may be placed on guild creation/joining based on free/premium account status
* Guilds can choose to be completely open to the public, application-based, or invite only
* Guild government style determines how campaigns and quests are created and approved:
   * Egalitarian: Pretty free-form. Everybody is the same level. Anybody can propose a campaign or quest. Majority votes for all decisions. There is an agreed-upon set of values that dictate the direction of the guild.
   * Open Enterprise: Membership levels based on contribution to the group and trust. Entry-level members need higher-level members to approve everything they do until they complete a certain number of quests that are accepted by higher-level members, then they can move up in rank (http://youtu.be/IdcAxGGRafc). There is an agreed-upon set of values that dictate the direction of the guild.
   * Representative Democracy: Core members are elected on a fixed schedule by the members. Core members can run the day-to-day operations of the guild without votes, and regular members have limited powers. Regular members can propose campaigns and quests that need to be approved by the core members. There is a constitution, voted upon by the members, that lays out the foundation of the guild, it’s principles and practices.
   * Constitutional Monarchy: Similar to a representative democracy, only the core members never change. There is a constitution, dictated by the core members, that lays out the foundation of the guild, it’s principles and practices.
   * Dictatorship: The core members of a dictatorship have absolute power, however, the dictator(s) can always choose to accept input from the members in the form of proposed campaigns and quests. The core members have the final say on all matters and there is no voting. Polls are available to gauge the opinions of the guild. No constitution or set of values is required, but are usually recommended.
* The ability to search for public guilds based on the keywords, letting people connect to each other through their interests
* Guild “rules” need to be able to be adjusted according to those rules so that changes can be made to the basic structure and governance of a guild.
   * for example, changing the guild from egalitarian to constitutional monarchy will require a ⅔ vote, and the monarch(s) will need to be selected by vote as well.
   * These “rules” will need to be modular and apply across the board, specific to guild government type.
   * For example, there should always be a way to change the guild government type from one to another, and the rules should reflect the type of gov. that exists now.
   * Voting majorities can be customizable, but are binding, unless changed by vote.
   * changes to “rules” will be the highest level of voting majority needed, and votes can be ranked by importance to determine the level of voting majority needed
   * another example, if a guild currently accepts new quests by simple majority vote, that’s a rule, it’s modular, and there’s a rule governing that in every guild, but the method of quest acceptance will reflect the gov. style. if the egalitarian guild with simple majority quest acceptance decided to change to ⅔ majority for quest acceptance, that would have to be put forth and voted on with some mechanism. probably the same, or similar mechanism to submitting quests.
   * am i getting way too complex with this?
* Guilds need to be aware when they are being created that some types of guilds can be driven right into left field, or off a cliff, if the membership decides to do so. The agreed-upon set of values or constitution should help with this, and this will be reflected in the “rules” as well.

* Health - BMI, Fitness, diet, etc
* Sociality
* Timeliness
* Multitasking
* Credit Score
* Friendliness
* Determination


Achievements and Badges
* Campaign completion milestones (1 completed, 5 completed, 100 completed...) and other milestones will trigger achieves that can be shared on social media
* Badges are awarded for something else? Is there a difference? Maybe badges are for completing pre-designated quests and site-specific things, like become premium member or the like.


General Features
* The game can have different “skins” so that it can be used in a professional setting by stodgy old executive-types
* Invitation only at first - closed beta - creating scarcity to generate buzz
* Rewards for spreading the word about the game. XP for getting people to sign up
* (maybe) Open Enterprise Guild model for the core development of the project, allowing it to be a truly community-based project. We’d probably need to have a public test server to make this work. It might also have to be open source. Have to think about this one. Possibly also invitation-only but Egalitarian.
* In-game currency, microtransactions, rewards for:
   * premium members get a fixed amount every month
   * recruiting new members
   * completing static quests we can actually track
* Data is private and portable, owned by the user
* 

Questions
* Does this work as open source? Would that make it more difficult to monetize? Is that okay?
* Does it work if it’s decentralized? Does the entire thing need to be under one umbrella to be effective?
* Hosted version can be paid while open source code remains available
