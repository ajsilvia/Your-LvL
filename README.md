Gamification productivity app with strong social integration

This is my first attempt at applicaiton programming, so please be patient with me :)

What Is It?

A personal productivity web- and mobile-based application that turns your projects into quests. completing quests and campaigns earns you experience points and rewards that you can share with your friends on your social networks. Peer pressure will help you stay motivated and competition will drive you to greater heights.

Campaigns and quests

Players can create campaigns, which are big-picture projects that they’d like like to complete. Campaigns are made up of quests, which are the tasks that lead to the completion of their projects. There might also be pre-built campaigns that players can unlock as they level up. These campaigns will be big reward projects, like learning a language, weight-loss, or other big projects. Completing quests and campaigns earns the player XP, which can be used for bragging rights and to unlock rewards. Quests can have sliding scales for earning XP. Quests that are time sensitive can be worth more for getting completed early or penalized for completing late. If the quality of a task can be measured then the XP can be adjusted accordingly.
Score of a completed quest can be determined by:
- timeliness
- quality of finished product
- complexity of the task
- custom/overall feeling of the group

Guilds

This is the really powerful part of the whole idea. Players can join up in guilds that could reflect real-world groups and organizations. These can be families, companies, volunteer groups, clubs, or any number of communities. Guilds can also create campaigns and quests for their members, making this an effective project management tool. Reports can be generated for the whole guild or per campaign so that a guild can see who contributes most (Guild Ranks?). Employers and clubs can use this to gauge performance and create their own custom rewards. Guilds will have different governmental styles, such as Egalitarian (group decision making), Representative Democracy, Open Enterprise (http://youtu.be/IdcAxGGRafc), Constitutional Monarchy, and Dictatorship. These different governmental styles will allow guilds to operate in the style that best fits their organization or project. Guilds can change governmental structures from one to another if the need should arise.

Achievements and Badges

Players will receive instant positive feedback for completing quests, campaigns, and other events. Achievements reflect incremental progress and badges commemorate big milestones.

Social Integration

Achievements, badges, campaign completions, and other events can be shared by the player on their social networks. This will help keep the player motivated through peer pressure. Players will also be able to connect to their friends in the game itself, and their friend’s achievements and milestones will be shared automatically on a Facebook-style activity feed.

Stats

Players can take quizzes to determine their stats, such as Timeliness, Sociability, Task Management, and more. These stats will try to be an actual reflection of the player’s real-world competencies. Completing quests and campaigns in a timely manner or consistently can contribute to raising (or possibly even lowering) these stats. Higher stats will allow the player to earn better rewards.

Classes

(This may not be necessary, requires testing. Maybe it's a 2.0 feature.) Players can choose a class that corresponds to their primary job responsibilities IRL. This will tailor the game to a specific set of campaigns and rewards that will help improve their job performance. Classes can be chosen in order to help a player work on specific stats, with pre-designed class quests designed to improve those stats. There will also be a “student” class available, that will reward the player for completing homework and getting good grades. (I think maybe we can give players two classes by default: Personal goals class and work responsibilities class. Premium players (or maybe through microtransactions?) can have more classes, maybe for their hobbies or clubs.)

Free and premium accounts

(Maybe. I'm still undecided about this part.) Free accounts are ad supported and limited (campaign/quest limit, limit on number of classes, limit on number of guilds player can join, and so on). Premium accounts have a monthly fee and all ads and restrictions are removed, plus additional rewards are available. Maybe a premium account will only be needed to create guilds?

Platform

A browser-based app and a mobile app both connecting to the same back-end so that the player can easily interact with the game and make updates. It’s important that it’s as easy as possibly for the player to use the game system or they won’t bother.
